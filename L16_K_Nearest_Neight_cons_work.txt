   spummer



measure the distance of x and find nearest neighbor  spum or not spum


0=4 is first nearest neighbor of x

pons and cons of KNN:
testing is challenging
find the value of k is another challen
computation is difficuit then is is slow

Advantages
it is simple take one point.if value of k is 4 then take the 4 nearest point of k.
easy for understanable
