Cat or Dog?


Features:We see the things that is called features.
For example eyes feets nose mouth ets is feature
or things that specify this that things is called feacture for e.g cat dog man


machine learning algorithm take input as feature and give output as label
Label: label like a tag

 


ML algorithm whats are feature and dectect features and give conculusion
