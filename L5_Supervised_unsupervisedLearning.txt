There are two types of machine learning algorithms:

 supervised  learning                                            unsupervised learning 

steps in typical machine learning problems 



Supervised Learning:
Machine knows something before hand
i: Already tagged data
ii: fearures and labels present
iii: classifaction
iv: regression




Unsupervised learning:
All machine knows is the data in front of it .No features no Labels
i:Data not already tagged
ii:features and labels not present
iii:training not done
iv: clustering and association




Supervised:
Classification:

Classify which label a given set of features belong to.

Regression:
Find out the value of the label using previous data.


Unsupervised:
Clustering:
Discover the inherent gruoping in the data such as
gruoping custenmers by purchasing behaviour

Association:
Association rule learning problem.Such as people that buy x also trend to by y.
