What is logistic Regression?


A Regression algorithm which does classifaction

Overfitting and Underfitting
                   
           :               
           :      
           :   
   y      1:         
           : 
          0:..................
                x

Logistic Regression:
why is called Regression because It is detect probability.
it is  classify a binary output.

Logistic Regression:


0                                 1
no posibility                  posibility

                                                   11         1
becuase non linearity we can not used means square error
We used here log loss

loss=-ylogy`      y=1
loss=-(1-y)log(1-y`   y=0 )

we can minimize loss








How Does Logistic Regression Work
it take feature and labels (training data)
fit a linear model(weight and biases)
and instead of giving you the result it give you the logistic of the result


Training a logistic Regression Model?
we need value of parameter of probabilities near 1 for positive instances.
we also want low values of probabilities near 0 for negative instances.
